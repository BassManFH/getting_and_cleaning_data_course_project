#Files for "Getting and cleaning data" course project on coursera

run_analysis.R - R script should be placed in the working directory with Samsung dataset unpacked
(place it inside "UCI HAR Dataset" by default)

It will go by these steps:<br />
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br />
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br />
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.<br />
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.<br />
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.<br />

It will return tidy dataset made in step 5, which also will be saved in tidy.txt
